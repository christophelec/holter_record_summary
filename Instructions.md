# Holter Record Summary

A normal heart beat produces three entities on the ECG â€” a P wave, a QRS
complex, a T wave.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography#Theory

Identifying those entities in a signal is called delineation. Here are CSV of
an algorithm output for a 24h ECG:

    https://cardiologs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/python-interview/record.csv

Rows have the following fields:
- Wave type: P, QRS, T or INV (invalid)
- Wave onset: Start of the wave in ms
- Wave offset: End of the wave in ms
- Optionally, a list of wave tags

Using Python 3, write a simple console program that provides the following
measurements to a physician:
- The number of P waves tagged "premature", as well as the number of QRS 
  complexes tagged "premature"
- The mean heart rate of the recording (Frequency at which QRS complexes appear).
- The minimum and maximum heart rate, each with the time at which they
  happened. As the date and the time of the recording are not included in the
  file, the user of the program should be able to set them.

Cardiologs should be able to easily recover your work, understand it, trust it,
maintain it, make changes to it, etc.

## Bonus question: 
We want to efficiently host delineations online, and be able to
quickly download a range of it (e.g. the record between 2 and 3pm on the third
day). How would you achieve that ?
